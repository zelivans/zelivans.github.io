# Welcome
Hi, I'm Ariel Zelivansky, a security researcher. Most of my published work revolves around open source projects. These days I am leading the security research team at [Twistlock](https://www.twistlock.com/). 

I'm going to try populating this website with my findings and advisories as much as I can, as well as publishing other blog posts. Most of my recent work, however, is published under [Twistlock's blog](https://www.twistlock.com/author/ariel-zelivansky/), so I suggest searching there first.

For code, see [zelivans at GitHub](https://github.com/zelivans).

Feel free to contact me for any reason at `ariel.zelivans at gmail.com`
